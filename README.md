# DottedIPParser

## Ovweview
DottedIPParser is a simple C++ class designed to handle IP addresses in dotted format (IPv4). It provides functionality to split a dotted IP address into its individual octets and display the address.

## Features
- Parses a dotted IP address (e.g., “192.168.1.1”) into separate octets.
- Displays the IP address in a human-readable format.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter an IP address when prompted.
4. The program will split the address into its four octets and display them.

## Example
Please enter an IP address in dotted format: 192.168.1.1
The IP address you entered is: ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 1 )
